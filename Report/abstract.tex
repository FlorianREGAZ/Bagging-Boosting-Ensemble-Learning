\section*{Abstract}

Ensemble Learning is a very powerful machine learning method, which combines
multiple smaller learning algorithms. Previous research has shown that 
ensembles often achieve higher predictive accuracy than an individual learning
algorithm in the ensemble.
In this report, we explain the Ensemble Learning methods Bagging,
Boosting, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, which are widely 
used by data scientists to achieve the best possible machine learning
models. Additionally, we evaluate and compare the named Ensemble
Learning methods against Decision Trees. This shows that Bagging,
Boosting, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting outperform Decision
Trees.
